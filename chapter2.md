## Semi-joins
Have you ever tried to filter data based on the combination of many variables. You could try to do this with `filter()`, but it will be much easier with a semi-join.

## Semi-join
Return just the rows of X that we have Y information for

## Semi-join 2
Do any of the rows in X match any of the rows in Y?

## A more precise way to filter?
We've attempted to rewrite this semi-join as a filter. Will it return the same results?

## Anti-joins
Anti-joins do the opposite of semi-joins, they show which rows do not have matches. Anti-joins are a convenient way to check for errors before they occur.

## Anti-join
Which rows of X do we not have Y information for?

## Anti-Join 2
Were any of the keys of X mis-entered? Use an anti-join to check

## Which filtering join?
Use a filtering join to determine how many matches exist between X and Y

## Set Operations
Set operations include union(), intersect() and setdiff(). They let you group observations from two data sets into a new data set.

--- type:NormalExercise lang: xp: skills: key:43cdc20718
## Union
How many unique observations are there in these two data sets?

*** =instructions

--- type:NormalExercise lang: xp: skills: key:81a91a27da
## Intersection
How many observations are shared between these two data sets?

*** =hint

## Setdiff
Which observations are in X but not Y?

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code

*** =sample_code

## Operations
Combine union and setdiff operations to return all of the observations that are in one data set, but not the other.

## Unique values
Will the result of this union statement contain fewer rows than the original data set? That would seem paradoxical.

## Comparing data sets
Use setequal or all.equal to check whether two data sets contain of the same observations.

--- type:NormalExercise lang: xp: skills: key:615ad28374
## setequal
Does the second data set contain any new information?

--- type:NormalExercise lang: xp: skills: key:49928bed70
## setequal
Write a filtering join that would also check if the second data set contains new information?
