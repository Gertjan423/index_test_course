title        : Filtering joins and set operations
description  : Filtering joins and Set operations combine information from data sets without adding new variables. Filtering joins filter the observations of one data set based on whether or not they occur in a second data set. Set operations use combinations of observations from both data sets to create a new data set.

## Semi-joins 
Have you ever tried to filter data based on the combination of many variables. You could try to do this with `filter()`, but it will be much easier with a semi-join.

## Semi-join 
Return just the rows of X that we have Y information for

## Semi-join 2 
Do any of the rows in X match any of the rows in Y?

## A more precise way to filter? 
We've attempted to rewrite this semi-join as a filter. Will it return the same results?

## Anti-joins 
Anti-joins do the opposite of semi-joins, they show which rows do not have matches. Anti-joins are a convenient way to check for errors before they occur.

## Anti-join

## Anti-Join 2 
Were any of the keys of X mis-entered? Use an anti-join to check

## Set Operations 
Set operations include union(), intersect() and setdiff(). They let you group observations from two data sets into a new data set.

## Union 
How many unique observations are there in these two data sets?

## Intersection 
How many observations are shared between these two data sets?

## Setdiff 
Which observations are in X but not Y?

## Operations 
Combine union and setdiff operations to return all of the observations that are in one data set, but not the other.

## Unique values 
Will the result of this union statement contain fewer rows than the original data set? That would seem paradoxical.

## Comparing data sets 
Use setequal or all.equal to check whether two data sets contain of the same observations.

--- type:NormalExercise lang:python xp: skills: key:8cf3f58cc7
## setequal 
Does the second data set contain any new information?

## setequal 
Write a filtering join that would also check if the second data set contains new information?
