title        : Mutating joins
description  : Mutating joins add new variables to one data set from another data set, matching observations across rows in the process. This chapter will explain the various ways you can join data sets together and what happens when you do.

## Welcome to the course! 
Introduction. Why use dplyr to join data? Many data sets come in multiple tables, in fact that's the easiest way to store large data. dplyr joins faster are faster than base merges and preserve row order. You can also use them with dplyr's built in SQL backend.

## Keys 
To join two tables you need to identify a pair of keys that connect the tables. Keys are variables whose values are shared across tables. There are two kinds of keys, primary and secondary.

## Primary keys 
Examine the data set, what is the primary key for this data set?

## Multi-variable keys 
In some cases the unique primary key is the interaction of two or more variables. What would be the primary key of this data set?

## Joins 
Demonstrate left_join() and right_join().

## Right vs. left 
Can you tell the difference between a right and a left join? How many rows will the result have if you right join the two data sets to the right. Each data set contains one unique observation per row. Pre-code should show the nrow() of two data sets and the nrow() of left joining them.
