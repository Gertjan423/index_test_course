title        : Advanced joining
description  : Now that you have the basics, let's dive deep into the mechanics of joins. This chapter will show you how to spot common join problems; how to join based on multiple, or mis-matched keys; how to join multiple tables; and how you can recreate dplyr's joins with SQL and base R.

## What can go wrong? 
Data entry errors can derail your joins. Here are the most  common types and how to search for them: duplicate keys in your data set and missing keys.

## Spot the key 
What is the primary key for this data set?

## Unique keys 
Does the primary key uniquely identify each row? (no, you can add your own primary key with add_rownames())

## Defining the keys 
dplyr gives you a lot of control over how you join rows in data sets. You can rely on dplyr to match up rows automatically, select a subset of keys to join on, or specify a join between keys that have different names.

## Which keys? 
Which keys will dplyr join on if you set by = "NULL" (the default)?

## A subset of keys 
Join based on just the x variable. What will happen to the duplicate y and z variables?

## Mis-matched key names 
Join based on just the X$x variable and the Y$y variables

## Joining multiple tables 
Joins are always defined as a relationship between two data sets. To join more than two data sets together, join them iteratively with the `purrr::Reduce()` function

## Other implementations 
Dplyr joins are analagous to other joins you may be doing (or may one day want to do) in other languages. Here we look at how to recreate dplyr joins with the base function merge and SQL.

TRUE or FALSE, you can recreate each type of SQL join with dplyr
