## What can go wrong?
Data entry errors can derail your joins. Here are the most  common types and how to search for them: duplicate keys in your data set and missing keys.

## Spot the key
What is the primary key for this data set?

## Unique keys
Does the primary key uniquely identify each row? (no, you can add your own primary key with add_rownames())

## Too many keys
Join the data sets together. What happens to the duplicate keys?

## Defining the keys
dplyr gives you a lot of control over how you join rows in data sets. You can rely on dplyr to match up rows automatically, select a subset of keys to join on, or specify a join between keys that have different names.

## Which keys?
Which keys will dplyr join on if you set by = "NULL" (the default)?

## A subset of keys
Join based on just the x variable. What will happen to the duplicate y and z variables?

## Mis-matched key names
Join based on just the X$x variable and the Y$y variables

## Joining multiple tables
Joins are always defined as a relationship between two data sets. To join more than two data sets together, join them iteratively with the `purrr::Reduce()` function

## Other implementations
Dplyr joins are analagous to other joins you may be doing (or may one day want to do) in other languages. Here we look at how to recreate dplyr joins with the base function merge and SQL.

## SQL
TRUE or FALSE, you can recreate each type of SQL join with dplyr
